# Call Centre - KPI Review üöÄ

## Project Background</br>
**PwC** is a global professional services firm that provides audit, assurance, consulting, and tax services. With a presence in over 150 countries, PwC helps businesses solve complex challenges, drive growth, and navigate change through innovative and tailored solutions.

One of the PWC offices has a significant amount of underutilized call centre data for its comprehensive digital transformation program. This project will thoroughly analyze and synthesize to uncover insights to help managers take decions for PWC success.

Insights and recommendations are based on the following key areas:</br>
1. Call Overview: An analysis of quarterly Customer Satisfaction Rating, Call Assessment Rate and Customer Satisfaction Rating.
2. Agent Performance: An assessment of Average Response Time (ART), Call Duration, Resolution Rate and Customer Satisfaction Rating.
